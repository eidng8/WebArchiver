WebArchiver
===========

A fork from STWebArchiver originally written by Shun Takebayashi.

The original STWebArchiver provides functions to download everything needed
for viewing a web page offline. However, it uses sychronous processes for
the job, and doesn't provide further control over to perform downloading.

This version revamps the original, by utilizing AFNetworking, to make
everything asynchronous, and provides more control over the course of action.
